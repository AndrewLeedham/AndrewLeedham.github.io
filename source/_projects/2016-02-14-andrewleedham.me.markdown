![mockup of andrewleedham.me](/img/projects/AndrewLeedham.me/mockup.jpg)
AndrewLeedham.me is my personal portfolio. It's aimed to show off my talents, and projects I've worked on. It also acts as a social hub, connecting my various accounts together.

The website is hosted on Github pages, and therefore uses the Jekyll Framework to manage project and blog posts. Github pages doesn't support backend logic, Jekyll is one of the few blogging tools that generates a static blog with no backend. This is my first project using Jekyll and I've learnt allot on the way, and come across a fair few issues. I also had to use [DISQUS](http://disqus.com) and [formspree](http://formspree.io) to handle blog comments and contact forms respectively, since there is no backend.

This is probably the third time I've redesigned my portfolio, over the last 5 years. I decided to take a design driven approach for this project, since previously I've just dived in at the deep end with code, and make stuff work, rather than focusing on design. This tended to lead to sloppy unimaginative thoughtless design. But this time I made the website in 3 steps.

1. Writing out the desired structure and feature set of the website, so I could visualize how each of the pages was going to fit together and work, and I could decide what framework would be best to use.
2. Designing each page in PhotoShop, I used the new artboard feature so I could visually see all the parts together.
3. Programmed the website, using various tools.

So when it came to actually coding the website, I was fully prepared and knew what challenges to expect.
