      <p>I'm a Nottingham born student, studying in Kingston upon Hull.
         I study Computer Science at the University of Hull and work as a telephone interviewer part time.

        I love exploring new fields in Computing, I find them all fascinating.
        I've found that Web Design is the most rewarding and intriguing topic,
        I've designed a lot of websites in my time, including this one, most of my other projects aren't live,
        since I tend to develop websites for fun and to learn with no intended purpose.
        I did an internship at <a href="http://riverdeneconsulting.com/">Riverdene Consulting</a> in 2012,
        where I produced a digital sign in system for the office, so they could pull stats from the employees punctuality.
