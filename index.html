    <p>
      I'm a Nottingham born student, studying in Kingston upon Hull.
       I study Computer Science at the University of Hull and work as a telephone interviewer part time.

      I love exploring new fields in Computing, I find them all fascinating.
      I've found that Web Design is the most rewarding and intriguing topic,
      I've designed a lot of websites in my time, including this one, most of my other projects aren't live,
      since I tend to develop websites for fun and to learn with no intended purpose.
      I did an internship at <a href="http://riverdeneconsulting.com/">Riverdene Consulting</a> in 2012,
      where I produced a digital sign in system for the office, so they could pull stats from the employees punctuality.

      I'd consider myself an amatuer Photographer, firstly sparked by my A-Level photography course.
      I tend to take landscape, technology and macro based Photography, feel free to check out <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/photo/">my work</a>.
