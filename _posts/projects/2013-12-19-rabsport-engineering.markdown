![mockup of andrewleedham.me](/img/posts/projects/Rabsport Engineering/mockup.jpg)
This project is the first one I've done for a client. I know the owner of Rabsport Engineering, and they approached me about the potential for a website. So we went over what should be included, and I got to work. The website is still under construction, since I'm waiting on some content to fill out the website.

This is the second iteration of the website, which is a more modern and fluid feeling design. Originally the website was built as a one size website, that doesn't work very well on mobile, but I soon updated the website to reflect new technologies, using the skeleton boilerplate to manage responsiveness.
