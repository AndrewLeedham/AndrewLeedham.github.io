World of Predictors (WoP) is a predictor generation tool built by Formula i Studios, I'm the lead designer of the project, and have been working with another develop to produce the web based tool.

Formula i Studios originally started of as a company to producing a F1 simulator game, using complex algorithms to simulate F1 races based on given inputs. The simulator would have teams and budgets which can be invested in to various aspects. Being our first collaborative effort, this was a daunting task, and after about half a year of development, we decided to move to something a little more simple. Thus WoP was born, WoP is intended to be a predictor game generator that can be embedded into forums or just played on the WoP website, this allowed us to continue through the project without a massive task ahead, the website will have features like user accounts, forums and of course the predictor itself.
