I feel like the first post on any blog, especially a developer, should be entitled 'Hello World!'. If it isn't is it a real development blog?

So to kick things of, hello world, how are you doing? My names Andrew and I'll be your guide on this tour throughout my thoughts, so sit back relax and enjoy the ride. Expect to see development news about projects I'm working on, problems I come across while I'm working and how I fixed them, University and life related stuff, and maybe the odd rant or 2 just for good measure.

A little about this blog from a technical standpoint, it's run using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which is a backend free tool, allowing me to develop the blog and run it through Github Pages which don't allow php or other backend scripts. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) basically compiles all the posts etc using templates once, then when the user requests a page, it sends them the precompiled page. For this reason I'm using tools like [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) and [Formspree](http://formspree.io/) to handle comments and forms respectively, since they're implemented using JavaScipt and use databases on there own servers not mine. I'm also looking into using [Prose](http://prose.io/) to implement a more user friendly post creating tool, than raw [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) files.
