I feel like every developer blog should start with a Hello World! post. If not then is it a real developers blog? Anyway this blog is intended for a variety of topics, basically just covering I find interesting. Expect to see a lot of design and programming related posts, as well as photography and general life stuff. Feel free to subscribe to the [rss feed](/feed.xml) so you don't miss a single post!

I guess I should probably explain a bit about myself as well. My name's Andrew Leedham and I live in the UK, I'm currently studying Computer Science at University, and I'm in my 2nd year, I plan to do a placement next year. I aspire to be a professional web designer, which my placement next year should hopefully bring me one step closer to. I would currently consider myself and amateur cyclist, photographer, web designer and programmer, since they're the topics I research and find interesting in my spare time.
