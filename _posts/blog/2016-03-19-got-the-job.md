I finally got the internship I wanted! Next year I'll be working for Xerox as a Web/Multimedia Front End Developer, I'm very excited to get started and move to my own apartment! My role consists of design for all sorts of different media formats with a focus on the web, so one day I could be illustrating icons and the next I could be create full websites.

I was interviewed for 3 roles at Xerox:
- Web Designer/Business Analyst
- Software Engineer
- Web/Multimedia Front End Designer

This was a suprise since I only applied for the Web Designer/Business Analyst Role. They offered me both the web roles, so I had to decide between the 2, I'm not suprised they didn't offer me the Software Engineer role since my CV is heavily web oriented. I decided to go weth the 'Web/Multimedia Front End Designer' role since I'm not that interested in the Business Analyst Role, and the way they described the role intruiged me greatly!

All in all I'm extremely happy, I had my doubt about even getting an internship when 2016 came around, but I'm glad I stuck with it. I'll have to move to yet another city, but I'm excited, I like moving, it is nice to just have a new start sometimes, even though it is very temporary.
