This photoshoot was for my A-Level photography course, the theme for the shoot was Macro photography of technology. Technology comes in all forms, so I thought I'd experiment with some more 'oldschool' textured items, this acoustic guitar is probably about 30 years old, and has lots of rust and texture, which really shows in this shoot. The photos were taken on my Nexus 5's camera and then edited using a compination of Photoshop and Instagram filters.
