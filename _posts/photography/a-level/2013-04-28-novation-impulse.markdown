This photoshoot was for my A-Level photography course, the theme for the shoot was Macro photography of technology. Me and a friend decided to buy a Novation Impulse MIDI keyboard to try and start creating music, the music creation part didn't really happen, however it did make a great subject for my photography, since it had lots of moving parts and flashing lights.
