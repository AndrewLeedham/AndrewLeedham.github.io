This photoshoot was for my A-Level photography course, the theme for the shoot was Macro photography of technology. Technology comes in all forms, so I thought I'd experiment with more traditional technology. The bike wheel has lots of detail, and interesting focal points, so I took it out for a walk, and photographed it against various backgrounds with various compositions.
