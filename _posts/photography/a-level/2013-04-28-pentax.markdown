This photoshoot was for my A-Level photography course, the theme for the shoot was Macro photography of technology. My dad gave me this Pentax camera, with allot of difference lenses and attachments to try and sell on eBay, so I thought I'd combine the photos for the listing with a photoshoot for my course.
