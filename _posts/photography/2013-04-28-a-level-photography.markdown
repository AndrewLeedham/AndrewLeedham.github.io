All of these photoshoots were taken as part of my A-Level photography course in 2013/2014. My coursework theme was macro photography within technology, and these photoshoots represent all aspects of technology, from musical instruments to computer components. I focused on various factors of photography within each of these shoots, including composition, texture and lighting, this massively improved my photography skills.
