I have tried to create a blog many times in the past. But I always start by coming up with a really extravagant design, and build process, and tech stack, etc. etc. I always get bored part way through and ditch it... Therefore, I have decided to change tack and start with the content, and improve the actual site over-time.

11ty seems like the best tool for the job, given it is very un-opinionated on front-end technologies and has great starter themes. Which works great with my vison of getting something going and starting to add content. It should hopefully provide a good base for experimentation as with any good personal site.

So, that is why my blog is currently using the base eleventy theme. Not that there is anything wrong with that, I just plan to make it my own.
