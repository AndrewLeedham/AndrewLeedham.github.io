If you are anything like me, you spend a lot of time on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) looking up how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features. To speed up finding pages, I have been using [mdn.io](https://github.com/lazd/mdn.io) for a while. It is a great project which allows you to append the property name or topic in the URL and go straight to the correct page. For example, [https://mdn.io/display](https://mdn.io/display) should take you to the CSS display property page. It works by doing an "I'm Feeling Lucky" duckduckgo search, which I have found is very consistent and reliable.
